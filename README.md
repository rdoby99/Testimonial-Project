# Testimonial-Project
Idea from JS-Beginners at https://github.com/JS-Beginners/testimonial-project.git

HTML&CSS not mine. JS file contains my own code, created WITHOUT looking at the solution.

## What I Learned

I loved this project. I got to use what I learned from doing the Background-Slider project in addition to using classes. At first, I thought I would make arrays for the image, name, and review text. However, I realized that if I did that then the information wouldn't be connected, so I decided to make the reviews instances of a class. I had trouble thinking about how I would loop through the class instances, but I settled on putting the instances in an array and looping through the array.

This is also the first project I've done where I like my code more than the solution's code. The solution didn't use an ES6 class and created an uncessary function to insert the image into the src contruction. My code was more straightforward and required less lines of code.

## Biggest Takeaways/Reminders
- How to create classes and instances
- How to loop through instances on a small scale
